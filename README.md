# MNASNET Tensorflow

 An unofficial implementation of MNASNet.
 Use Tensorflow Slim.
 MNASNet is a CNN model proposed by Google for mobile devices.It is faster and more accurate than previous models, such as Mobilenet V2 and Shufflenet V2.

## Object Detection
  We tested the replacement of ResNet with MNASNet-b1 as the backbone of RetinaNet.Evaluation on the MSCOCO17 val after training on the MSCOCO17 train dataset.We have achieved a mAP of 33.7.We have achieved a mAP of 33.7, which is slightly better than using MobileNet V2 as the backbone(33.7 vs 33.4).All work on object detection uses the [object detection api](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) of tensorflow.We just wrote a feature extractor and related configuration files.

## How To Use
 The basic implementation of Mnasnet is in the /mnasnet directory. If you want to use it, copy it to the /slim/nets directory, then add mnasnet to [nets_factory.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/r1.13.0/research/slim/nets/nets_factory.py).
 
```python
networks_map = {
                #......
                'mnasnet_a1':mnasnet.mnasnet_a1,
                'mnasnet_b1':mnasnet.mnasnet_b1
               }

arg_scopes_map = {
                  #......
                  'mnasnet_a1':mnasnet.training_scope,
                  'mnasnet_b1':mnasnet.training_scope,
                 }
```
 If you want to use mnasnet in the [object detection api](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), we provide the implementation of retinanet.Copy the files in the /object_detection/models directory to where the object detection api is located, then add the model to [model_builder.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/r1.13.0/research/object_detection/builders/model_builder.py).The configuration file is provided in the /object_detection/samples/configs/ directory
 
```python
#......
from object_detection.models.ssd_mnasnet_fpn_feature_extractor import SSDMNASNetA1FpnFeatureExtractor, SSDMNASNetB1FpnFeatureExtractor
```
 
```python
SSD_FEATURE_EXTRACTOR_CLASS_MAP = {
    #......
    'ssd_mnasnet_a1_fpn':SSDMNASNetA1FpnFeatureExtractor,
    'ssd_mnasnet_b1_fpn':SSDMNASNetB1FpnFeatureExtractor,
}
```

## TODO List
 
  * [x] Upload the code for object detection
  * [x] Freeze the object detection model and upload it 
  * [ ] Training the MNASNet A1 model (in progress, estimated to take 60 days)
  * [ ] Evaluation on mobile devices (I am sorry that I don't have a Google Pixel 1 phone, I might buy a newer phone for evaluation)
  * [ ] Provide more pre-trained models (our limited computing power)
  * [ ] Send PR to tensorflow
